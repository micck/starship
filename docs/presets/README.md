# Presets

Here is a collection of community-submitted configuration presets for Starship.
If you have a preset to share, please [submit a PR](https://github.com/starship/starship/edit/master/docs/presets/README.md) updating this file! ðŸ˜Š

## Default: Nerd Font Symbols

This preset doesn't change anything except for the symbols used for each module.
If emojis aren't your thing, this might catch your eye!

The configuration file also includes all default settings, so that you can easily change them.

### Prerequisites

- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) installed and enabled in your terminal (the example uses Fira Code Nerd Font)

### Installation

1. Download the <a href="/presets/downloads/nerdfont/starship.toml" download>starship.toml</a> file
2. Place the downloaded `starship.toml` in your `~/.config/` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory
3. If you would like to adjust the configuration to your needs, open the file in your editor (for more details see the <a href="https://starship.rs/config"><strong>Configuration section of the docs&nbsp;â–¶</strong></a>)

## Default: Powerline ##

This preset is customized to look like a _Powerline_ prompt, but still keeps the default colors. It also uses the Nerd Font symobls instead of emojis.
It looks best, if you do not use the [Line Break](/config/#line-break).

## M.y.t.h.: Dark/Pointed

It looks best, if you do not use the [Line Break](/config/#line-break).
